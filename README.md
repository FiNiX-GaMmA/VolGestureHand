# Volume Gesture Hand Control
This Python Project helps you to control you desktop/laptop's volume remotely using only your hand.
When using any of my code give me the acceptable credits.
Download all the files and then run the code.
in Pycharm use OpenCV module and Mediapipe as interpreters to run the file correctly.
